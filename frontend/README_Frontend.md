To correctly run this program and ensure that no cross origin requests are blocked, run the program through a new chrome window created by the command "chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://chrome-dev-disabled-security" --disable-web-security --disable-site-isolation-trials". Make sure that your working directory is that of which the Chrome.exe file is located in before running the command. Once this window is open, navigate to localhost:4200 to use the app. To use the application to its full extent, create and account and upload some images to your map to view later. Sign in to view these posts after your account has been created.
