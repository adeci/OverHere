## Description
Over Here is an image sharing and hosting website with the aim to showcase where each image was taken. Users will be able to scroll across a world map with visible tags where photos were taken by other users. Upon zooming onto the tags, these tags expand to show the image that it was representing. Users can also upload their own photos to the website and their photos will be placed on the public map. The goal is to get users interested in visiting new places through real photos that other users have taken and uploaded.

## Instructions

**1. Navigate to OverHere's root directory.**

- You should see frontend, server, and other folders.

**2. Run the command 'make runback' to start the backend server. Wait until it's receiving requests.**

`make runback`

**3. Run the command 'make runfront' to start the frontend client. Wait until Angular is loaded.**

`make runfront`

- Both 'make' commands are shortcuts that utilize a Window's makefile. To run on Mac or Linux, open Makefile from the root directory and run the corresponding commands directly.

**4. Create a new chrome window created by the command:**

 `'chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://chrome-dev-disabled-security" --disable-web-security --disable-site-isolation-trials'`

- Make sure that your working directory is that of which the Chrome.exe file is located in before running the command. 

- To correctly run this program and ensure that no cross origin requests are blocked, run the program through a new chrome window created by the command

**5. Navigate to localhost:4200 on the new chrome window to use the app.**

- The app is now running. To use the application to its full extent, create and account and upload some images to your map to view later. Sign in to view these posts after your account has been created.
