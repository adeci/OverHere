## Description
Over Here is an image sharing and hosting website with the aim to showcase where each image was taken. Users will be able to scroll across a world map with visible tags where photos were taken by other users. Upon zooming onto the tags, these tags expand to show the image that it was representing. Users can also upload their own photos to the website and their photos will be placed on the public map. The goal is to get users interested in visiting new places through real photos that other users have taken and uploaded.
